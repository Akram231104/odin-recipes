    <h1>Apple Chips</h1>
    <h2>Description</h2>
<p>These apple chips with cinnamon will disappear almost as quickly as you make them! They're <strong>perfect</strong> as a healthy snack and <em>easy</em> to take on the road. The secret is to bake them at a very low temperature for a long time, dehydrating the apples.</p>
<h2>Ingredinents</h2>
<ul>
    <li>2 Golden Delicious apples, cored and thinly sliced</li>
    <li>1 ½ teaspoons white sugar</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
</ul>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Step 1:</strong><br>
        Preheat the oven to 225 degrees F (110 degrees C).
    </li>
    <li><strong>Step 2:</strong><br>
        Arrange apple slices in a single layer on a metal baking sheet.
   </li>
   <li><strong>Step 3:</strong><br>
    Mix together sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl; sprinkle over apple slices.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Step 4:</strong><br>
        Bake in the preheated oven until apples are dried and edges curl, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Use a metal spatula to transfer chips to a wire rack until cool and crispy.
    </li>
